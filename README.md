## Keyboard View

## Input method API
Service component, class with callbacks for providing IME’s UI.
Handling user input, and delivering text to the field that currently has focus. By default, the Input Method Service class provides most of the implementation for managing the state and visibility of the IME and communicating with the current input field.
